I have very thick, coarse, long hair that frizzes very easily. I used this recently on a beach trip and I was amazed. My hair is awful at the ocean. It gets so ridiculously frizzy and is so unmanageable. After using Biolage hydrasource shampoo and conditioner my hair was soft and smooth and was not very frizzy.

I had recently used the last of my Redken So Soft Shampoo and Conditioner and wanted to try Biolage's Ultra Hydra Shampoo and Conditioner to compare. I really wish I had repurchased Redken as it left my hair feeling silky for days (even my husband complimented it!) Biolage Ultra Hydra smells lovely but wow, my hair is SO dry after using it. I'm really surprised at how awful it makes my hair look and feel. I will definitely be sticking to Redken after this.

So I've purchased the regular size of this product approximately 3 times and it is my holy grail conditioner. As someone with very long hair down to my behind, this stuff makes my hair soft and hydrated. When I saw the large size on sale for only a few dollars more, I immediately purchased it. I am so disappointed!!! The consistency is way off. I even double checked my order and the bottle to make sure i got the Ultra hydrasource and not a different one. The one i received is the consistency of body lotion whereas the product from the regular bottles is thicker, like a body butter. Its an immediately noticeable difference. The caps on the bottles indicate a purposeful consistency change. The large bottle has a cap that you press down on one side and the other side lifts up and the product is dispensed in a sort of thin rectangular ribbon. The regular bottle top just has a large hole for dispensing. This makes sense because the product is thick. The product Ive used from the regular bottle would never be able to be squeezed through the type of cap on the large bottle. I honestly believe the product in the large bottle is thinned because they think most people would just replace the cap with a pump, which would require the product to be a thinner consistency in order to be dispensed. I still used the conditioner because i didnt have any other options at the time. My hair is still smooth but is absolutely not as hydrated. I am extremely disappointed in this and will only be purchasing the product in the regular size bottles unless they plan on making that product thinner as well.

I have been using the regular and the Ultra Hydrating Shampoos and conditioner since the late 90s. This line is the best I have ever used on my wavy/frizzy/sometimes curly/persnickety/dry hair, and I have tried both pro and drugstore brands throughout it all but always come crawling back to Biolage. It is the only line that makes my hair feel soft and clean. Only once did I receive a bottle of ultra hydrating conditioner that was questionable in quality, and it was one I had ordered online for curbside pickup at my local Ulta during the height of the pandemic. It definitely was NOT the same product inside the bottle, that's for sure. It barely hydrated my hair and was runny like other people have stated, as if it were watered down. I guessed it was due to manufacturing issues during the time, so I never returned it. I have had the same issue with a few other items purchased at different Ulta's (non Biolage that I also didn't return), so maybe the watering down of products is more of an in-store internal issue than a manufacturing one.

I used Biolage for 7 years now and never had an issue, except the last 2 orders I received. I thought it maybe was a fluke on my first order so I ordered again and it was the same consistency/texture as the first order. Both orders were runny as if it's watered down. It doesn't lather as it should (no suds no bubbles) my hair doesn't feel clean when I get out of the shower. My hair dries out quicker now too than it ever did before. Before it had a nice shine/non frizz healthy looking hair. Now I'm back to looking for something else to use.

Switched from Hydra Source conditioner and I can feel the difference, not that Hydra Source wasn't very good. But my hair is very dry, course, and gets tangled at the nap of the neck. With Ultra, I can pretty much run a comb through my hair when wet without having to use any leave-in supplement.

It has great slip both in and out of the shower. That means it conditions really well and makes the hair softer. I barely need a detangler. I always get this and another. It took me a long time to find the right one but I'm so glad I did.

EVER SINCE GOING BLONDE 5+ YEARS AGO OF COURSE MY HAIR DRIED OUT A LITTLE FROM THE BLEACH. I USED TO USE REGULAR PRODUCTS BUT MY HAIR ALWAYS FELT DRY AND TANGLED QUICKLY. I STILL USE REGULAR SHAMPOOS BUT USING BIOLAGE CONDITIONER HAS BEEN LIFE CHANGING!!!! I EVEN TRIED OTHER HIGH END CONDITIONERS AND THEY STILL FEEL SOMEWHAT DRYING AND DON'T LEAVE THE HAIR FEELING AS HYDRATED AFTERWARDS. WITH BIOLAGE BRUSHING MY HAIR AFTER SHOWERING IS SOOOOO EASY! THIS IS A PLUS FOR ME CAUSE MY HAIR IS WAIST LENGTH AND THERE IS LESS TANGLES THOUGHOUT THE DAY. AMAZING PRODUCT! IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY ON HIGH END SHAMPOOS & CONDITIONER... THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY 👍🏼 RECOMMEND TO ALL

I have naturally curly hair that does get straightened often. Not to toot my own horn but I've been pretty lucky and always had really nice hair, But I was looking for something hydrating but with a mild scent. I tried the travel size first and fell in love I was so excited I actually liked it. Went all in and purchased the jumbo size shampoo and conditioner. After a week of use, my hair was so dry and stiff I couldn't even get a brush through it without using a detangler spray first. My hair is dry, frizzy, and feels like a really cheap Halloween wig. I started to notice breakage as well. I really wanted to love this but it was a huge let down for me. Worst my hair has ever been. Everyone has a different experience but I am utterly disappointed and I am desperate to get my hair healthy again.

I got this for a deal that Ulta was doing and honestly it doesn't impress me. I'm starting to see a lot of hair fall out and every time I wash my hair with the shampoo and conditioner my hair gets stiff and tangly. I would get an itchy dry scalp so I had to get another product to help with that. the smell is strong but the good thing that it does help with color haired. I've used it with my blue hair, brown and blonde.

I've used this product intermittently for 15+ years. Over the last 5 or so it's become my go-to. I have fine, type 3 curls, low/medium porosity and medium density. I can't even begin to tell you how many different shampoos/conditioners I've tried, and I always come back to this set or the Ultra Hydrasource. I've never experienced any hair loss whatsoever, in fact, I have with other brands and once I go back to this it stops. The smell is absolutely amazing also! I wash my hair 1-2x a week with the shampoo, and in between I use a co-wash from Curlsmith. I always start with using the detangling solution from this line and brush through in the shower with my wet brush. I rinse, shampoo with this, then use this conditioner or a deep conditioner. I comb that through and let sit for several minutes and rinse. Even with very dark natural hair and having bleached highlights (touch ups every 3-6 months), my hairdresser brags about how healthy my hair is! I get a trim every 8 weeks, and she always tells me I don't even need it because of how healthy my ends are, even during post-COVID hair issues I was experiencing (loss and thinning). My husband also started using this shampoo AND conditioner when he ran out of his Redken Brews and his hair is VERY fine and thin, and he said he couldn't believe how much better his hair looked and felt (he's also a curly guy, only getting his hair cut/shaved 2-3x year). I absolutely recommend this, and won't ever change from it! I've been using it exclusively for the last 2 years.

My hair is very long (waist length) and fine but I have lots of stands. I get my hair highlighted usually a few times a year. I can't use just any shampoo and conditioner because a lot of them tend to dry out my hair. My hair tangles very easily and is a rat's nest trying to brush out while wet. With this shampoo and conditioner, it makes my hair incredibly soft without weighing it down, and makes brushing it out after showers so much more manageable. Did I mention it smells amazing? Will definitely continue using this line.

I wanted to try this shampoo and conditioner to help hydrate my processed hair. It is fine but I have alot of it and some breakage from highlights. I temporarily used a drug store product to hold me over before choosing this one, and the cheaper brand felt better for my hair than this! Even after the first use my ends were super dry and somehow more tangled.

I've been using the conditioning balm on my blonde wavy/curly hair forever. I just purchased a new bottle a week ago because I was running out. I used the new bottle today for the first time and I instantly noticed the formula is not the same. It is watered down and it would suds up if I rubbed it between my hands. It stripped the natural oils in my hair and left it dry and stiff. I'm very disappointed and will be returning it.

gives hair mask results without the added weight. only conditioner that actually makes my dryyyy brittle thin blonde hair feel SO soft and silky (even when its wet) after every use. worked so good that my hair didnt have a single tangle after a full day at the hot windy beach (and i even forgot to use a leave in spray!). the key really is to leave it on for a few minutes. salon quality hair. so good im ordering a second jumbo. just try it!

I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few months and it destroyed my hair. It was great at first, made my hair silky and soft, but overtime it stripped my hair of its natural oil. My hair just looked fried and was always tangled. I never use heat to style and have no other explanation for the damage to my hair. After a haircut and deep conditioning treatment, my hair is back to life, but I will never purchase from the Biolage line again.

I purchased the smaller size to try this brand. I've had a hard time finding a product that didn't build up on my hair/scalp and causing ingrown hairs. This product definitely did not cause any issues. I have thin curly hair and I can finger comb after showering and I have no tangles whatsoever. I feel it does leave my hair soft as well. I don't love the smell, but it doesn't stink either. I have never used this product previously, so I can't speak to any type of ""formula change."" I would likely purchase this product again.

This seriously is probably the best shampoo and conditioner i've ever tried! And i'm a cosmetologist so i've tried a lot lol. After only one use my hair feels SO much better. It's ridiculously soft and silky like i just came out of a hair commercial lol. It gives so much hydration but none of the gross oily or stiff feeling silicone or waxy coating that a lot of ""hydrating"" hair products give. Please please give this a try if you have dry, frizzy, or damaged hair. I will be using this for years and years to come.

My hair has been through it. I bleached my hair while living (by the beach) in California for years and never had any issues. I moved to the mountains in Utah a couple of years ago and the altitude combined with the very hard water made a MESS of my hair. I could barely dye it with 20 volume without it breaking off. I have been searching high and low for something that would condition, smooth and moisturize my very thirsty hair. This is it! And it smells great! My hair is medium length, fine but very dry and damaged copper balayage. So a lot of maintenance for health while preserving the color is important. I love this conditioner. It works perfectly for my hair. Does not weigh it down or make it greasy (and my scalp is pretty greasy) or strip my color. If your hair is damaged or dry, I highly recommend giving this is a shot.

I have ALOT of thick, wavy, yet manageable hair. I typically wash my hair every couple of days, and this conditioner keeps my hair clean, soft, and hydrated in between washes. What I love most about this conditioner is that it's clean and paraben free and doesn't weigh my hair down. I've used this conditioner for a couple of years now, and I will keep repurchasing! I read some of the low rated reviews and honestly CANNOT relate with the issues those people had with this product, in my honest opinion there are a number of reasons for dry hair or hair loss that may have nothing to do with the product but possibly the individual's life and environment, but everyone is different. This conditioner is a definite staple in my life, 10/10 would recommend:)

I have been struggling with extremely dry, frizzy hair for years, and this year it's been even worse. My ends felt like straw, my hair was constantly getting tangled and falling out and the only hot tools I use is a flat iron maybe once or twice a month. I've spent so much money just in the last few months on products that either haven't worked or made my hair even worse. I came across this in Ulta and decided to try it because it claims to do everything I need and the smell isn't overpowering. After one use of this and the matching shampoo my ends feel like silk, I can run a comb through my wet or dry hair without losing clump after clump. It may be a little expensive for shampoo and conditioner but considering how much money I've wasting trying to find something that works this is absolutely worth it to me.

I was so excited to get this conditioner. I've used Biolage products in the past and loved them. I have thick, wavy hair, so I'm all about good conditioner. I wanted to get something salon quality without having to go to one during a pandemic. After using this for a few weeks, I've been extremely disappointed and stopped using it. It somehow made my hair so incredibly dry and tangly (which it typically never is) every time I used it, I was losing hair like crazy trying to comb it.

I have been using the Ultra Shampoo and Ultra Conditioner consistently or over 15 years and have always sworn by it because it is the best conditioning system for my dry hair. I KNOW this product. It has always worked beautifully. However, I noticed a drastic change in the formula of both the ultra shampoo and ultra conditioner the last time I bought it. Neither one had the same creamy consistency and dried out my hair a LOT! The conditioner felt and performed horribly and was more like a $1 brand. Is this a new formula?!? I normally would recommend them, but not if the formula has changed.

I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask about 2 months ago. I noticed right away that the shampoo made my hair extremely dry and that the conditioner did nothing to help. Even the mask did not help my scalp and hair. Brushing my hair after showering has become a nightmare because my hair is so tangled! Around the same time, I began losing HANDFULS of hair when showering and combing my hair. Just last week, I clogged the shower drain with all of my hair (I'm surprised I have any left). I thought the hair loss/ breakage was maybe from working out and wearing my hair in a high pony so much. For the past two weeks, I've used a leave in detangling spray, combed my hair from the bottom up, and began wearing my hair in a braid while working out, hoping all of this would help with hair breakage. It has not. Tonight I took a shower and lost another great deal of hair. I'm finally realizing it's the shampoo and conditioner. This wasn't my first guess because I paid so much for them and I thought this brand was supposed to be really great for damaged/fragile hair. After reading these comments of others losing hair, I feel sure that it's the shampoo and conditioner doing it. What a waste of money. And I hope my hair recovers from this!

My favorite shampoo and conditioner were discontinued and I've been on the hunt for a replacement. I have fine, limp, very damaged/dry hair that's just wavy enough to be frizzy and ruin any haircut. On top of that, I have ridiculously sensitive skin that can be irritated by the most mundane ingredients. I picked this up because I used it the past and really liked it, unfortunately, it's nothing like I remember. If I don't get it rinsed completely my hair is left greasy, taking the time (which feels like forever) to make sure it's rinsed all the way out leaves me with a tangled, frizzy, hay-like mess.

A little goes a long way with this conditioner. I used too much at first, the amount I usually need with other conditioners, which is about a half dollar amount, but that amount with this conditioner made my hair too oily. I tried a less than a quarter size amount and that was good. I probably could use even less than that. I have grey hair that was damaged by a perm a year ago. I've been trying to repair the damage ever since. I'm 51 years old. This shampoo and conditioner by bioloage hydrosource I believe will be what my hair needs to get back to a healthy look and feel. After only using the shampoo and conditioner four times, my hair looks and feels better. My husband had to touch my hair because he said it looked so soft and shiny. His fingers went smoothly through my hair without getting caught with tangles. Usually, his fingers get caught by knots. I used to have to brush my hair three to four times a day to get knots out, but since using bioloage hydrosource conditioner, I blow dry and fix my hair in the morning and only have to touch up once later in the afternoon and I always brush my hair before I go to bed. It's not a chore to brush my hair before bed anymore. So far, I really like this conditioner.

I have coarse, wavy hair that really liked this conditioner. But it made my scalp sting a bit when I put it on and over the course of a week it made my scalp flakey and itchy. It has a really strong fragrance that seems to be pretty high on the ingredients list. I think this is what is causing my issue. It's too bad cause it's a great conditioner.

I have been dying my hair for the past few years, and recently started bleaching it. After my last hair session my hair was fried and straw-like for weeks. After deciding to give this a try, I will never go back. My hair is so soft and noticeably healthier. It is very powerful so I use half the amount I would usually use. Overall in love!

The Matrix Biolage Color Care conditioner is my HG. I am currently not coloring my hair, so I wanted to try something new so I grabbed a bottle of this. I have a lot of super fine hair. After a couple uses, this completely dried my ends out. I already have problems with my hair falling flat, but this make it lifeless. Looks like it's back to the color care line for me.

Love this conditioner! It's pretty much the only thing I'll use. I have stringy hair, fine and thin and it tangles very easily. This conditioner does a fantastic job at detangling and I'm able to brush my hair with ease and not worry about a bunch of knots, broken hair, pulling and yanking. I just ordered the largest bottle while on sale. Hopefully my boyfriend doesn't use it all this time. Lol. He loves it just as much as I do.

Love this conditioner. It is nice and thick and provides lots of slip. My hair is very fine and wavy and just shy of shoulder length hair. I use 2 to 3 pumps and finger comb it, then use a wide tooth comb to distribute evenly. I then let it sit for about 5 minutes and rinse out. It leaves my hair very moisturized without weighing my fine hair down. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fragrance is very strong.

I used this product in combination with the shampoo for a little over a month. I almost finished the product entirely. It made my hair soft, shiny, and reduced my frizz. So why the 3 stars? IT DRIED MY SCALP SO BADLY. I continued to use it because I liked how my hair looked. I even tried applying aloe vera/oils/different home remedies in combination with continued use of the product with hopes to cancel out it drying out my scalp but nothing worked. I was forced to seek an anti-dandruff shampoo, which has helped but the damage is intense and will take a while to reverse. This product did make my hair look nice but it is not worth the dry scalp.

I have thin hair but quite a bit of it. I liked this conditioner as I could feel it rehydrating and helped with the tangles a lot and I don't feel like it gave me any build up like a lot of products do. I used after using the Biolage clarifying shampoo which helped rehydrate. I felt like it wasn't quite enough to completely rehydrate tho so I'll be switching shampoos.

I really liked this product and since it's expensive would use a smaller amount and then extra conditioner if needed from a cheaper brand, but after switching to just Aussie hydrating conditioner instead I noticed it was super comparable to this product but cheaper. The conditioner is very thick and hydrating but you can find better value using a drugstore brand like Aussie.

The shampoo and conditioner smell nice. They give a decent rinse. But omg this started to make my scalp feel sooooo itchy and created dry patches and mini scans on my scalp. I was literally picking tiny dry chunks and scabs out of my hair. I think this was so intense that it over moisturized and caused my scalp to do the opposite of what I wanted.

I picked this up during the liter sale at the beginning of the year, and it's now August and I still have 1/3 of the bottle. Having a pump means I use less product, plus the quality formula provides better results with less. As for the product itself, I'm in love. My hair is the best it has ever been. I have curly, dry, damaged hair that I'm trying to grow out. And normally by the time I use up a normal bottle of shampoo and conditioner I have to switch brands because of the buildup. Not with this brand. My hair is always soft and wonderful with it.

I have bleached blonde, wavy, dry and frizzy hair, and this helps a lot! I paired this with the Matrix So Silver shampoo, and it works really well. I switched from OGX Brazilian Keratin shampoo/conditioner, and while it made my hair less dry, my hair was still frizzy and my waves weren't as defined. This conditioner helps brings back my waves and less frizziness, I definitely recommend!

Love to use Biolage products. They always smell great (even though I'm sensitive to fragrances! Allergic to most!) and make my hair feel so soft. The purple line - ultra hydrating - is my favorite because I have dry, thick hair. Sometimes I have to alternate to a different brand and go back to to Biolage; but I can always feel my hair soak the Biolage back up when I haven't used it in a while. It'd compare it to an instant quench! Just make sure to rinse THOROUGHLY! It takes a few rinses for my super thick hair. Well worth it.

I LOVE this conditioner! I was a bit confused at first since it's called a ""Conditioning Balm"", but I am so glad I bought it. I was struggling to figure out why my hair was dry with dandruff and no shine. I had started going to a new salon to get my hair done ever 12 weeks, bought Biolage Matrix Scalp Sync Shampoo, bought an Aveda hair mask to use weekly, and started using more heat protectants. However, I still was using conditioner I bought at my local grocery store. Once I started using this conditioner my hair immediately changed. The shine was like never before and my dandruff completely disappeared. My hair stays soft and shiny for the 2-3 days between washes. I love this stuff so much!

I've been using Bio forever. A little goes a long way. It smells great, and doesn't weigh hair down. I leave it on a few minutes and during that time, I massage it in. You don't have to though, but I like to. I wash it out with warm water, since hot water will strip your hair. Once you wash it out, make sure you wash it completely out. This takes a little effort, but worth every moment. I then use a dab of hair serum and do a professional blow dry (in sections) from bottom to top, and flat iron each section as I go. Since my hair is naturally curly, with a freeze, I will always have to follow all these steps to get salon blow dried, straight silky, volume hair.

I live in Utah and the weather is extremely dry, specially during the winter. 🙄 I had been trying to cut my hair more often because the ends were just dead and dry. I couldn't stand to keep cutting my hair shorter and I was using the Matrix sleek shampoo and conditioner and then one day I decided to give this guy ☝🏼 a try. I bought the shampoo as well. It changed my hair and hydrated it from day one. I noticed a difference and I was so excited because it was on sale at the time!! So I stocked up. Now I don't have colored hair, but i don't think it makes a difference. So if you're struggling with dry damaged split ends, this is for you! It didn't leave my hair feeling heavy or weighing it down as mentioned by others, and I have very thick hair!

I keep coming back to this shampoo and conditioner. I always like to try new things and I constantly try different hair products looking for something that really stands out. I've used many professional brand conditioners and I always come back to this one after others fall short. I have thick, wavy, color treated hair and I want a thick conditioner to provide moisture and help maintain manageability. This conditioner does a good job.

Like the matching shampoo, this conditioner adds moisture without leaving my hair limp or greasy and without freaking out the psoriasis on my scalp and neck. The smell isn't great but it isn't obnoxious either. Since I use a leave-in that smells lovely I don't really care. I find it much easier to detangle my hair after using this. Good stuff.

I bought this along with the shampoo and was happy with how creamy and moisturizing it was. I was looking for a conditioner that would help my dry damaged hair and was either going to buy this or the redken extreme conditioner. I am glad I purchased this instead of the extreme conditioner because from my experience with using redken products biolage is way better. Instead of my hair feeling full of residue and weighed down it feels free and flowy like it has been cleansed and refreshed. Would definitely buy again.

Biolage is for hair what water is for flowers; it's essential, there aren't any comparisons-especially for the price. If your hair feels heavy, lackluster, or blah, it's time to take a little vacation from your regular routine and try Biolage shampoo/conditioner (there are a myriad of varieties for all hair-types, too!). I'm telling you, you'll be happy you did and your locks will be gorgeousness!

I'm not greatly into buying the expensive brands for beauty products as I'm generally pretty cheap and simple. I will forever be okay with splurging on this brand of shampoo and conditioner, however. It's by far one of my favorite (next to Redken's All Soft) and works extremely well on my long hair. I'm prone to get dry ends and my hair lacks moisture as I live in a dry state and tend to wash it each day. This product makes it smooth and healthy and you really can't beat the fragrance. Nice lather and rinses out wonderfully! Will be buying this until I am old and gray :)

First of all, I LOVE the way this smells. I wish I could find a perfume that smells like this stuff! This conditioner moisturizes my dry, frizzy, wavy hair pretty well and does not leave a residue. I almost with this would moisturize it a little more though, but I suppose that's pretty tough with my hair type. It almost always seems like it's lacking hydration and life. I really keep coming back to this stuff because of the way it smells. I will continue to buy this until I can find something that smells just as amazing and gives my hair more moisture.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this product. It appeared to change the texture of my hair... Combined with the Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo, my hair became very brittle, dry, and difficult to manage. (even some breakage) I tried to blame my hairdresser but, it was the product.

They have changed the formula for this conditioner (despite the false sticker ""same great formula""--it is thinner and the color has changed, and the ingredient list is different). I used to LOVE Biolage hydrasource conditioning balm. It made my hair soft and shiny and healthy. This new version leaves my hair with a weird texture, and with SO much static! It sticks to my face and flys out like I've been electrocuted. I'm appalled at such a drastic change to a previously great product. Don't waste your money on this--I sure won't be again.

About a week passed and I ran out of my old bottles so I went to try my new ones. AWFUL. JUST AWFUL. they are watered down and don't smell as fragrant as they usually do. Going to the mall in the next couple days to return product.

Liz D
Wood-Ridge, NJ
I was told by a Biolage rep that this was the same conditioner as the Ultra Hydrating Balm conditioner that I thought was discontinued. That conditioner was only one of two conditioners that ""work"" on my hair. Everything else seems to leave my hair frizzy, dull, and dry and breaking. So I was thrilled when they assured me that it was the ""same great original formula"", just in new packaging. The ingredient list on the Ulta site for the Ultra Hydrasource conditioner did match the ingredient list on my old Ultra Hydrating Balm container. But when I received the Ultra Hydrasource conditioner in the mail recently from Ulta, I saw that although most ingredients were exactly the same and listed in the same order, phenoxyethanol had been added pretty close to the beginning of the ingredient list in the Ultra Hydrasource formula. Not sure why Biolage had to add so much of a preservative in a formula that worked fine for years. I have to use the Ultra Hydrasource conditioner a few more times to see if I notice a difference. I used it once, and my hair does seem frizzier than normal and more hair seemed to break after I used it. I just wish the Biolage rep hadn't said the ingredients didn't change when clearly they did. Until I know for sure that the results are the same or close enough to the old Ultra Hydrating Balm formula, I have to classify this product as ""No, I would not recommend this to a friend"", unfortunately.

I used this product followed by the conditioner . I let the conditioner set in my hair for about 20 to 30 mins and rinsed. I then greased my scalp with Cantu shea butter tea tree & jojoba hair and scrap oil then applied cantu shea butter leave in conditioner. As well as putting oil on my hair. I blowed dried it using the comb like blow drying technique . Then I straightened it using thin strands. My hair came out very healthy, sleek, shiny , and smooth. I am an African American with VERY VERY course hair who has not had a perm in 5 months and with these techniques my hair came out better than it ever has with a perm. It came out looking like I had used the Saran Wrap technique. Definitely worth it .

Matrix conditioners are by far the best. I have fine, brittle hair, but lots of it. This product keeps my hair from drying out and breaking. It is a bit heavy, but my hair has plenty of volume on its own. If applied all the way to the roots, it would likely make your hair look greasy pretty quickly, but thats easily avoidable. Matrix Biologe products all have a distinct smell and I could easily see how someone wouldn't like it, but it doesn't small good or bad to me.

I didn't like the poor quality of this conditioner, felt no different than a drugstore brand.

A hair ""professional"" told me I had very dry hair and recommended this product. She said it would work miracles. I told her I had sebhoric dermatitis and she said it would work great for me and said I should use it INSTEAD OF the Aussie three-minute miracle I had been using which she said was terrible. The Biolage made my scalp worse and I am definitely going to return it and go back to my Aussie 3-minute miracle.

I'm not sure why this is getting good reviews, but this stuff is not even comparable to the old stuff. This product was heavy and you end up having to wash your hair again by the end of the next day. I still have some of the old stuff that I'm using very sparingly and it's like a breath of fresh air/hair. Clean, curls stay, breakage resides and no washing until 3 day. No comparison at all to the old stuff. BIOLAGE - BRING BACK OUR PRODUCT. IF SOME OF YOUR CUSTOMER WANT PARABEN AND SULFATE FREE THAN MAKE THAT A SEPARATE LINE, BUT LEAVE OUR PRODUCT ALONE

First, let me say that I recently bleached my hair to a platinum blonde color, which causes extensive hair damage (dandruff, itchy scalp, very very very dry hair, frizz, etc.). I came into the Ulta at the Sunrise, Citrus Heights, CA location looking for an effecient conditioner for my newly-made hair and the ladies there directed me straight to this and seemed to know exactly what I needed. They were very helpful and seemed to know a lot about their products as far as ingredients and hair benefits go, which I really appreciated. As for this product, I saw an instant difference (after using it and blow-drying my hair). It made my hair look and feel like it was healthy which was awesome coming from the frizzy mess I was left in. I use this in the shower after shampooing (with Ulta's Matrix Total Results So Silver Shampoo). I leave it on for about 3-5 minutes, rinse it out very well, brush my hair with a wide tooth comb (when wet), blow-dry and flat iron (Don't forget heat protectant for the hair!) and voila! Healthy, shiny tame hair :)

I have coarse, thick, naturally curly hair. (That is also very long.) This c extremely well; with very little product needing to be used. (With the liter pump attachement, I use two pumps.) It has not stripped my color; nor does it make my hair feel like straw, which most shampoos do. It's a perfect purchase for the budget minded, because a liter can last three months! Also, since the fragrance isn't a strong floral, my husband uses it too! (I shampoo twice a week, he's daily)

I have thick black hair that gets permed every 8 months or so. My hair is dry but I have an oily scalp. This shampoo is gentle on my hair and leaves it soft, but does not feel greasy or heavy. (When I've used other kinds of shampoo for dry hair, sometimes it leaves a ""silicon"" feeling film in my hair, which this doesn't). I use the conditioner from this line too.

I have type 4 hair with medium/coarse strands, curl pattern intact, and my go to style for the past year and a half has been a silk press. I've only washed my hair once since I got it a couple weeks ago, but I'm in love. The effectiveness of the product makes it to where you don't need to use much per section but, simultaneously, the consistency and formulation make it difficult to overuse. By that I mean, if you are heavy handed (even though you don't need to be with this product), your results will still be good. Most products cause your hair to be weighed down, sticky, and difficult to brush or blow dry if you use too much, but not this. I thought I messed up when I used too much on one section. It felt sticky but it ended up soaking in and felt extremely soft. This product being so lightweight cut my blow dry time in half. It was also the straightest, flattest, darkest, shiniest and most flowy I've ever been able to get my hair with just blow drying. I can usually get it pretty straight, but it takes forever, ends up looking kind of grey/dull, isn't really flowy, and is pretty bulky. I will say that maybe because this product is so lightweight, it doesn't really control fly-aways or static. After straightening my hair, it looked amazing. It still looks amazing right now, a week later. Super flowy. I didn't need to ""bump"" the ends or style my face framing layers to try and add shape because my hair ""sat"" right while being completely straight. But I noticed that a lot of tiny hairs in my crown and part just weren't laying. And no, it's not breakage. The ends of the individual hairs taper which is a sign of the beginning of a new hair, not a broken off one. Also, some of the ends throughout my layers were sticking out. Brushing them into place or adding oil didn't do anything. I had to break out the dryer sheet to get rid of the static. I use a silicone-based heat protectant after blow drying/before flat ironing and I'll probably switch it out for one of my heat protectants with hold to keep everything in place. I actually prefer heat protectants with hold for style longevity but HAD to switch to a silicone based one a while ago to counteract the aforementioned ashiness/dullness I typically get from blow drying. But that won't be an issue anymore if I continue using this leave in. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

I have very fine, very thin, long, straight, bleached hair. I have struggled my whole life with static and wind-induced tangles. In the winter months, I often develop tangles through the day where my hair rubs on my clothing (especially acrylic sweaters). If I am outside on a windy day I end up with plenty of tangles too. 99% of leave-in conditioners I have tried were a hard-pass because the left my hair flat, greasy or dirty feeling. Kenra Daily Provision has the consistency of water and I can reuse it 2-3 times per day for several days in a row between wash days. It does not build up at all (but I love clarifying shampoos, so I still clarify every 1-2 weeks). I either spray directly onto the ends of my hair if it is really tangled, or spray it onto my Tangle Teezer brush (the mint colored one for Fine & Fragile hair - I think Ulta is the only place that sells it - so put it in your cart with this Kenra Daily Provision!). The fragrance isn't memorable at all - not good or bad. I have never tried it on damp hair, but it is the holy grail for gently removing tangles and static in very fine, thin, long hair throughout the day and between wash days.

This has rescued my daughters hair every year after swimming all summer. I recommend it to literally everyone. My favorite thing about it is I could douse her hair with it and it will soak in and make it super soft and shiny but not leave even a bit of residue. For fine hair, it's so hard to find that!

My hair is fine and has thinned just slightly so I wanted something to detangle, condition, and protect it without weighing it down (at all!). For my purposes, this is the perfect product! It's really not meant for very coarse, frizzy, or damaged hair and if I feel like my hair needs something more because I've been heat styling too much or have done something else to it (salt water!), I will use a mask or a creamier repairing leave-in. But this is exactly what you want for fine hair for an every day (or every wash day) type of use. I do add a styling product after this just depending how I'm styling my hair - might be for control/hold, volume, curl, etc. but this is always my first step. Sometimes I use nothing else after this when my hair is healthy and I'm air-drying it and I've still been very happy with it for those low-key days.

First time user and I'm impressed. Kenra Daily Provision leave-in conditioner is awesome. I've used it when my hair was damp and also tried it when it was dry. The results were great. It doesn't weigh down my curly hair and gets rid of the fizzies I usually get when I comb my hair later. It has a really nice fresh scent too! I love it!

This product works well. I live in a dry climate now and my hair seems to have a life of its own! Being able to use this product after my shower make my hair more manageable and easier to style. You just spray it on your damp hair, blow dry and style as usual. I like how nice my hair feels! It's not a heavy feeling and doesn't leave my hair weighted down.

I just want to start off by telling you about the bottle, I just love the silver color and I love how the cap can easy be put back on after I use it, it snaps back on snug so that the product stays good. I really love how great this smells so good, it's not an overpowering smell it's a light, simple smell but it smells so good! I love that this spray leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I have also noticed that this spray also leaves me with less to no knots. My hair is very prone to knots and I'm really happy that this spray leaves me with less knots. I would recommend this spray to anyone who is looking for a leave in conditioner that smells super clean and leaves your hair shiny and smooth. My hair just feels and looks so much better now that I have been using this spray! I noticed that if I spray it before I braid my hair that it holds the braid together firmly.

I was really impressed with the Kenra Daily Provision Leave In Conditioner. Normally when I use leave ins, I have to add a little bit of oil to my ends to prevent my ends from frizzing up when the leave in dries. In this case no oil was needed. My ends which is another problem area for me looked really good and all I did was apply the leave in and let it dry. My hair when it dried was soft and very manageable. I really like this product.

I was looking for a good leave in conditioner for when I air dry my wavy frizzy hair, but it was like I sprayed straight water on it. So dry & frizzy. I dried my hair the next time I tried it & it was softer, smoother, & less frizzy, but a little sticky. There are many drugstore heat protection sprays that work as good as or better than this.

This product smells really nice, and if you're looking for a super lightweight leave-in, this may work for you. As another reviewer said, it's like spritzing water in your hair. I have very fine hair, and I have a lot of it. My hair gets tangled in the wind, from moving around all day, literally anything I do — it gets tangled. I use a detangler/leave-in post-shower, otherwise my hair is full of knots. I usually use ""its a 10"" but I hate how expensive it is, so I've been trying new ones... if you're anything like me and struggle to find something that works, just pass on this one.

We are a family of 3 girl- ages 48, 18, and 16. We had been using Kenra products for about 2 years, then recently switched to Redken brand because my stylist opened her own salon and switched to a product she thought would be more affordable. We are all switching back to the KENRA line. I can't say enough positive about this product. One of my girls has hair down to lower back and just switched back to this product and it already looks much healthier! I don't know what they do to their products but they all smell amazing, no gritty feeing, no residue! It just does what it says and conditions! We usually use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner as well. Slowly switching back after my Redken is gone!! You don't need to use a ton of the product, it goes a long way. I myself have used the perfect blowout as well. Wonderful product and I'm not being paid for my opinion, although I wish I was!! I always shop ulta for my jumbo shampoos and hair products!

So...I'm obsessed with the Kenra line now because of the blow dry spray! But I'm not as impressed with this product. I have used it as a leave in conditioner after towel drying my hair but it seems like I'm just spritzing water? BUT!!!! When I use it on my daughter's hair, she is 8, it's like it's a completely different product! It detangles her hair and makes it shine and so so soft and smooth!!! I can use it on her hair every single morning (wet hair or dry), and she washes her hair 2x a week. No residue or greasiness. My hair must be dryer than hers and may need a bigger boost?

I balayage my hair every 3 months so I always need a good leave-in to combat dryness and damage. I was recommended Kenra Daily Provision by my stylist because she uses the products in her salon. I was not disappointed, smells amazing and always leaves my hair soft and smooth. The best part is that a bottle will last me forever since you don't need to use a whole lot of product for it to be effective. It's not heavy at all like some can be and doesn't weigh my hair down at all. Love it!

I bought this on a whim, not expecting much. Boy was I wrong! After one use, I'm hooked! My hair has never felt this soft. It literally feels like silk. I can't believe how good this is and the smell is so good too. Similar to Kenra sickening gloss scent. This is a must buy! You'll love it!!! My hair feels like silk/buttery soft. It doesn't weigh my hair down at all. I use this in my hair while it's wet after washing it and add a few other products before blow drying. This Kenra Daily Protector is a holy grail product. It doesn't detangle as well as other brands but I'm ok with that because the end result is incredible!

I was expecting a lot more since I've used the Kenra curl cream in the past with good results. This leave in conditioner did nothing for my curly wavy hair. Instead it felt limp and flat.

I love several Kenra products such as the moisturizing conditioner and shampoo. They are great products for all hair types. I also use the clarifying products. The products have a nice smell as well.

My hair is very fine and this product does not weigh it down or leave residue. Have been using it for 5+ years and love it!! Not a big fan of scents either, and this fits that need too.

This is a leave in conditioner that is not much more than a nice smell. I usually love Kenra products but am disappointed in this product. It didn't detangle very well and didn't really soften my hair.

I spray my hair before i brush it and after I towel dry it. I no longer am ripping out and breaking my hair. It is soft and smooth when I dry it. I wish I found this sooner!

I wanted a leave in conditioner for my permed and colored hair and this is ok. I usually use another brand but I wanted to try it out since this is more of a salon product and I thought it might work better. But it isn't any better than the other brand I was using.
