Pump a small amount of shampoo into your hands and lather well before applying. Massage into wet hair, focusing on the scalp and roots and then rinse. Repeat as necessary. Gentle enough to be used daily. Follow with the HG Conditioner for optimal results. Pro Tip: We love a good double cleanse, especially if you have fine hair, oily hair, or recently transitioned to a natural, sulphate free routine. If you're making the switch to natural haircare formulations, you may temporarily experience oily hair as a result of the detoxification process. As your scalp rebalances from chemicals to natural ingredients, try decreasing the amount of product used and thorough rinsing.

Hard-working ingredients like amino acids, plant-based oils, jojoba esters and coconut oil help inject moisture into every strand.","Details
Benefits
Moisturizes the hair
Helps provide deep hydration to dry and damaged hair
Vegan and made in the USA with globally sourced ingredients
Key Ingredients
Amino Acids: Supports hair strength, fights frizz and reduces the effects of breakage for overall hair health
Plant-Based Oils: A blend of Babassu, Soybean and Flaxseed oils help to detangle strands and support smoothness
Jojoba Esters: Condition and protect the hair while also supporting the reduction of dry scalp
Coconut Oil: Can help provide moisturization to the hair strands to support overall hair manageability
Formulated Without
Parabens
Synthetic Fragrance;How To Use
Apply Divi's Conditioner to wet hair, focusing on the ends. Let the product sit for at least three minutes to work in and work its magic. Comb product through hair and then rinse thoroughly. For added scalp care, apply Divi's Scalp Serum to towel dried hair. Since your follicles will be open after a shower, the Serum will absorb quicker and may provide an even greater tingling sensation.
Pro Tip: Sometimes, when you transition to a product like Divi's Conditioner that uses clean ingredients rather than harsh chemicals, it takes a bit for your scalp and hair to adapt. If you find that your hair feels a little heavier than normal, Dive recommends adjusting your wash frequency, rinsing your hair thoroughly with cool water or applying less product.

Rinse as you'd normally do and repeat as desired.
After you've rinsed out your shampoo, take your Bottle-Free Beauty conditioner bar and either rub the bar between your hands and distribute into hair, or apply the bar directly in a painting motion top to bottom. Focusing on the length and ends, simply add a bit of water and continue to ""paint"" to activate the ingredients.
